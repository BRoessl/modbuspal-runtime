# modbuspal-runtime
modbus simulator - headless docker runtime for modbuspal configurations

fork of https://sourceforge.net/projects/modbuspal/ but heavily modfied to extract just a headless docker runtime. The idea is to use original modbuspal as UI tool to export a project files which you can then use to feed in to the runtim.
